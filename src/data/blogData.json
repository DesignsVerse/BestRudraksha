For peace of mind, choose lab-tested certified Rudraksha from bestrudraksha.com."

In Ujjain, this is often done near Mahakaleshwar Temple while chanting “Om Namah Shivaya”.\n\n2. **Energize the Rudraksha**: Sit facing east and chant “Om Namah Shivaya” or “Om Hreem Namah” 108 times while offering incense or flowers. This activates its spiritual power.\n\n3. **Choose the Right Day and Time**: Wear it on a Monday or during Shiv-related occasions, especially after a morning bath. Consult Ujjain experts for compatibility based on your birth chart.\n\n4. **Wear It Correctly**: Use a 108-bead mala or wear as a bracelet—men on the right wrist, women on the left. Avoid crossing the Sumeru bead while chanting.\n\n5. **Follow Lifestyle Guidelines**: Maintain a sattvic diet and lifestyle. Avoid non-veg, alcohol, intimacy, sleep, or funerals while wearing it.\n\n6. **Regular Maintenance**: Clean monthly with water or Ganga Jal, apply sandalwood or mustard oil to prevent drying."
